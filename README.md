EyeTracking
================
This code was written as a part of Yahoo Hack U! 2013. The app detects eye movement and understands gazing behavior to undestand app usage pattern of the user. It uses some of the codes from [FaceDetectionPOC] (http://www.trappers.tk/site/2012/05/02/face-detection-with-core-image-on-live-video/).
